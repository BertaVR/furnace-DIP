# furnace-DIP
This is a project to learn DIP and casting. It's about a heating system, the aim of this project is that, higher level classes don't depend on lower level classes. We learnt how casting works thanks to Yoda, which is a jedi, a heating system whose method works in a different way than the on in the interface heater.
